# 🗡️ Lost Ark Honing Symulator (LAHS) 🗡️
### Simulate, don't speculate your way towards progress!

Rails app created at the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) as final project.

1. **TARGET**: competitive Lost Ark players assessing their ability to progress towards the most recent content released.
2. **PAIN**: Lost Ark players, instead of spending hours in spreadsheets attempting to **guess** if you're ready to progress, **simulate** the process and get your answer - *in style*!
3. **SOLUTION**: we've created an aesthetically clear and pleasing to use simulator.
4. **ORIGINALITY**: it sports a full visual theme to replicate ingame experience and track your spendings. Dull unclear spreadsheets are a thing of the past!

2. Select item to hone.
